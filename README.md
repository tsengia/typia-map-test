# map-test

Example test for [`Map` objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map).

When `typia generate --input src/ --output generated` is run, the `generated/map-test.ts` file is produced.

As you can see on line 8 of generated/map-test.ts, this is an incorrect serialization of the Map object type.
